This post was originally going to be about standardized testing, but I've decided to not to be the author of the 74594859th generic post about the SAT that's not helpful to anyone (granted, the topic I've selected isn't really better in that respect). Standardized testing, however important it may be to my future, is just not something I personally care about.
