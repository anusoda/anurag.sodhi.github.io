One of the primary reasons I have decided to make myself a website is to start a blog in order to help filter the vast mess of thoughts that entire my head by putting them to paper (or keyboard). The blog format is meant to force me to write things that are intelligible; otherwise, I would have just kept a diary. I simultaneously hope that everyone I know will read this blog and also that no one will ever learn that this blog exists. Is that weird?

I could make this first post something meta and edgy, like blogging about blogging (I suppose I'm blogging about blogging about blogging now). After some thought, I think I'll divide the blog two; one for some stream-of-consciousness nonsense for my personal gratification, as well as another for more formal posts, maybe about issues that I care about or cool things that I'm autodidacting (currently one of my favorite words).

I am already starting to face some obstacles in my blogging experience â€“ writing is pretty hard, isn't it? To make sure that I actually end up using this blog, I won't require myself to follow strict English criteria (to the dismay of my English teachers, although they'll probably never see this blog anyways). I'm also worrying too much about who will read this, but I suppose that's natural. It do be what it do be.

### Error

**Error:** No one cares, can you blog about something relevant???

Maybe once in a blue moon I'll write something I'm confident in sharing.
