Hi, my name is Anurag Sodhi! I am currently a junior at Centennial High School (graduating in 2024) interested in chemistry, physics, math, computer science, and loads more. I do a lot of academic competitions, including chemistry olympiad, Science Bowl, Science Olympiad, and quizbowl, among others. I also lead/help lead numerous clubs at my school, include the math team, science journal, python club, and National Math Honor Society. 

Outside of academics, I am a third-dan black belt in Taekwondo. I also enjoy playing badmintion (very poorly), Ultimate Frisbee (also very poorly), chess (even worse somehow?), and Tetris. I am also an unapologetic fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
